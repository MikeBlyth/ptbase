This project is a basic, web-based electronic medical record system which was developed in 2005 at ECWA Evangel Hospital
(now Bingham University Teaching Hospital) in Jos, Nigeria. It uses Ruby on Rails version 1.x with a SQL backend database.
It included demographics, outpatient visits, admissions, problem list, drug prescribing with automated calculation for 
common and anti-retroviral drugs, lab orders and results, growth charts, graphs of HIV-related parameters, alerts, and reports.
While it did serve our needs at the time, it would probably no longer be a useful starting point and is kept on GitHub mainly 
for reference purposes. Some user and maintenance documentation can be found at http://bit.ly/18JmH2J.
